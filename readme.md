How to use
##########

First, the usual:

1. Install the app (adding `llm` to `INSTALLED_APPS` in settings)
2. Add a valid `OPENAI_API_KEY` to `settings`
3. Include llm/urls.py in your Django project
4. Run migrations

Then, create your own prompts, prompt data, urls, and register the widgets. The easiest way to do this is simply search for "TODO" in this repo. Examples are given in code for each step.
